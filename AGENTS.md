# Project architecture
tcp-wake is a wake-on-demand reverse proxy in Go deployed as a container on
hyperion in front of hypha (normally powered off). It holds hypha-bound requests
with no deadline, execs a setuid-root wake command, polls hypha's `/health`, and
forwards held requests verbatim once healthy. Source of truth: `docs/architecture.md`
(arc42, 15 ADRs accepted) plus `specs/SRS.md` and `docs/implementation-plan.md`.
Build order: T1 (blocking prerequisite) then T2–T16. See `docs/implementation-plan.md`.

# Learnings
- **T1 / setuid in containers.** The setuid effect depends on the mount options,
  not just the file mode. `/tmp` on this host is a `nosuid` tmpfs, and a Docker
  bind mount inherits the source filesystem's options, so a stub built under
  `/tmp` shows mode `4755` but executes with no privilege. Build the stub in the
  repository checkout (btrfs root subvolume, no `nosuid`). The definitive check is
  to **execute** the binary and read `geteuid()`, not to `stat` it. Verified PASS
  inside `debian:stable-slim` as uid 1000 (`effective_uid=0`).
- Use a glibc-based image (`debian:stable-slim`) to run glibc-compiled stubs;
  Alpine's musl gives a misleading `not found` on a glibc dynamic binary.
- **Environment.** Arch Linux VM; `arch` user is in the `docker` group; Docker
  29.8.1 with daemon active. `sudo` is available for root-owned artifacts.
